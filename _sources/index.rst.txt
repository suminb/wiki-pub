SB Public Wiki
==============

Mission Statement
-----------------
Turn *wasted* research hours into public knowledge.

Rationale
---------
Software engineers, including myself, spend a non-trivial amount of time for
going through various resources online (i.e., Google, StackOverflow, etc.) to
search for technical information and knowledge. If we are lucky, we find
information we need without much struggle by scrambling few keywords. However,
if we are unlucky, in which we are in many cases, we end up digging through a
load of documentations and mailing lists like a detective chasing after a crime
suspect.

This process inheritently gives us great opportunities to expand our horizon,
discovering alternatives of our current technical decisions, less-known
features of a particular technology, and other interesting stuff. Over time,
we tend to forget what we've learned in the process, especially when they are
irralavant to the problem at hand.

Even if we are dealing with relavant materials, it is difficult to remember
all the gory details like parameter names, option names in a configuration
file, environment variables, and so on and so forth. This brings us back to
where we started. We find ourselves in a situation where we dig into the
matters that we have seen at some point in the past.

What if we took some note about our findings? What if we at least saved the
URLs of the materials we found with some keywords or perhaps with a brief
description? We could have saved a lot of time for ourselves. Or, even
better, we could have saved someone else's time and effort. The would could
have been a better place.

This project has started in an attempt to salvage some of those wasted
research hours by turning them into public knowledge.
